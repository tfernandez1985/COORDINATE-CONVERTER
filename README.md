# COORDINATE-CONVERTER
Coordinate converter for the surveying industry for Texas and New Mexico
Important File Requirements
CSV File Headers: For the tool to function correctly, your CSV file must contain the following headers, regardless of the conversion type selected:
Longitude
Latitude
Northing
Easting
If any of these columns are missing, the tool will not be able to execute the conversion, and an error message will prompt you to verify the file structure.
Steps to Use the Application

Select Conversion Type:
Choose either "Northing/Easting to WGS84" or "WGS84 to Northing/Easting" from the dropdown menu.

Select Your File:
Browse to select the CSV file, ensuring it contains all four required headers.

Select the Region:
Choose the appropriate region (e.g., TEXAS CENTRAL or NEW MEXICO EAST) to apply the correct UTM projection.

Run Conversion and View Output:
The converted coordinates will display in the Preview Converted Coordinates section and be saved directly to the original CSV file.
Note: If any of the required headers (Longitude, Latitude, Northing, Easting) are missing, the tool will display an error, prompting you to update the file before attempting the conversion.
